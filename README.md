2. Be Respectful

- Respect is the foundation of any good community. Treat everyone with kindness and dignity, even if you disagree with their opinions or beliefs.

    - If you need to tell an admin member about a serious problem that requires talking about a sensitive topic, please do so in a thread in the #general channel.

- Posting NSFW or harmful content will result in an instant ban.

5. Use Channels Appropriately

- Each channel is designed for specific types of content. By posting in the right channel, you help maintain the organization and make it easier for everyone to find relevant information.

- Stay On-Topic:
    - Each channel has a specific focus. Always post content that aligns with the purpose of the channel. For example, don’t post personal chat in the projects channels.
    - Use general discussion channels for casual topics or unrelated conversations.

- Community Projects Channels:
    - If you are sharing your own project or work, post it in the #general channel **only once**. If you want to get your own projects channel, please let a member of the Ivirius team know.
    - Each project channel has its own guidelines, so make sure to follow those when posting.
    - Project channel owners have complete jurisdiction over their channels.
    - Keep project-related discussions focused on the specific project and avoid spamming the channel with unrelated messages.

- Ivirius Community Projects Channels:
    - For projects created by @ivirius.software or related to Ivirius Community, use the designated `Projects` category.
    - These channels are strictly for official or team-related projects.

- No Cross-Posting Between Channels:
    - Don’t copy and paste the same message into multiple channels. Cross-posting can clutter the server and disrupt the flow of each channel.
    - If you need feedback or discussion in multiple areas, consider summarizing the content and directing people to the appropriate channel.
    - Forwarding messages is allowed if done within the limits of a casual conversation. Abusing this will be considered spam.

- Respect Channel-Specific Rules:
    - Some channels may have additional rules for posting content (e.g., image or file size limits in media channels, specific formatting for project posts).
    - Always read pinned messages and channel descriptions to make sure you understand any specific guidelines for that channel.

- Posting in the wrong channel will result in a reminder to move your message.
- Repeated off-topic posts or disruptive behavior in project channels may result in a warning or temporary mute.

6. No Unhinged Behavior

- We encourage a fun, lively community, but unhinged or erratic behavior can disrupt the experience for others. Keep things balanced, respectful, and avoid actions that could make others uncomfortable or cause chaos.

- No Outbursts or Aggression:
    - Avoid sudden outbursts, aggressive behavior, or extreme reactions that disrupt conversations or create an uncomfortable atmosphere.

- Keep it Calm and Civil:
    - Maintain control over your actions and reactions. While passionate discussions are fine, extreme behavior (e.g., yelling, rage quitting) is not acceptable.

- No Over-the-Top Drama:
    - Drama or exaggerated behavior for attention is discouraged. We want to keep things fun and engaging without unnecessary disruptions.
    - Disapproving of someone being a member of this server without proof of them breaking a rule is strictly prohibited.
    - You are not allowed to ask server admins or Ivirius team members to give you roles.

- No Senseless Arguments:
    - Engaging in arguments just for the sake of arguing or provoking others is not tolerated. If a discussion becomes unproductive, move on.

- Maintain Emotional Control:
    - If you feel frustrated or upset, take a break. It's okay to step away from a situation rather than reacting impulsively.
    - This server is not meant to be a teenagers hub or emotional support group. Please keep your personal life to yourself.

- Unhinged behavior will result in a warning, followed by a mute or temporary ban if the behavior continues.
- Severe or repeated outbursts may lead to a permanent ban from the server.

7. Private Testers and Confidentiality

- The private testing channel is reserved for verified testers who have agreed to follow strict confidentiality guidelines. As a tester, you are trusted with pre-release content and are expected to handle it responsibly.

- Verification Process:
    - To become a tester, you must go through a verification process. Simply asking to join does not guarantee access.
    - The verification ensures that testers understand the responsibilities involved and are trustworthy.

- Confidentiality is Crucial:
    - Anything shared in the private testing channel is confidential. Do not share, leak, or discuss any testing content outside of the designated channels.
    - Leaking information about unannounced features, bugs, or updates will result in immediate removal from the testing program and possible server bans.

- Respect for Non-Disclosure:
    - Do not post or share screenshots, videos, or any other form of content related to the software you’re testing, unless given explicit permission.
    - Avoid discussing the test in public channels or with anyone who is not part of the private testing group.

- No Spoilers:
    - Avoid giving spoilers or hints about upcoming features, releases, or updates unless explicitly allowed. This includes hinting at or teasing new features that could spoil the experience for others.

- Feedback and Reporting:
    - Testers are expected to provide constructive feedback and report bugs or issues they encounter in a timely manner.
    - Use the designated feedback channels and follow any guidelines set for submitting reports.

- Country Restrictions:
    - If you live in the following countries: `Russia, China`, you are not allowed to become a tester.
    - This rule is to make sure copies of our apps do not get distributed in the countries we blacklisted.
    - Do not try to fight this decision claiming it is discriminatory or racist. The blacklist exists for your safety and to comply with the laws of these countries.

- Violating confidentiality, leaking information, or failing to follow the rules will result in removal from the testing group and potential server ban.
- Severe breaches of trust will lead to permanent removal from the community.

8. No Wild Claims

- Making unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims can mislead others and disrupt the community. Stick to facts and avoid making statements that are misleading, false, or overly subjective without evidence.

- No False or Misleading Statements:
    - Avoid making claims that are not backed by evidence, such as calling a program "malware" without proof or spreading misinformation.
    - Statements like “Rebound 11 is malware” or “one software is better than another software " are not allowed.
    - You are allowed to show your support for a project as long as you do not actively compare it to another project.

- Avoid Unsubstantiated Comparisons:
    - Everyone has different preferences, so try not to elevate one product while putting down another unfairly.
    - Do not trash talk a project to support another.

- No Extremist Opinions on Platforms:
    - Claims like "everyone should use [Operating System/Device]" or similar statements that try to push a singular viewpoint on others are discouraged.
    - People should be free to choose what works best for them without being pressured or shamed for their preferences.

- Encourage Civil Discussion:
    - If you want to discuss your preferences or opinions about software or operating systems, keep it respectful and allow room for differing opinions.
    - Debate ideas constructively rather than making absolute claims.

- Repeated wild claims will result in a warning.
- Continued violations will lead to a temporary mute or ban, depending on the severity of the claims.

9. Provide Constructive Feedback

- Constructive feedback helps improve the community and projects. If you have suggestions or criticisms, make sure they are thoughtful, respectful, and helpful.

- Be Specific and Clear:
    - When providing feedback, be specific about what you like or dislike. Instead of saying “This doesn’t work,” try saying, “The feature crashes when I click this button.”
    - Offering clear examples or detailed explanations helps others understand your point of view.

- Focus on Improvement:
    - The goal of feedback is to improve, not to complain. Frame your criticism in a way that encourages growth, such as, “It would be better if this feature had X because Y,” rather than just pointing out flaws.

- Be Respectful:
    - Feedback should be given respectfully. Avoid using offensive language or attacking others. Remember, everyone is working hard to make things better, and a positive approach will yield better results.

- Stay Open to Responses:
    - Understand that not all feedback will lead to immediate changes. Developers and staff may need time to consider suggestions or explain why certain decisions were made.
    - Keep an open mind and engage in productive dialogue.

- Provide Solutions When Possible:
    - If you notice a problem, try suggesting a possible solution or improvement. Offering ideas on how to fix an issue makes your feedback more actionable and helpful.

- Repeatedly giving unhelpful or disrespectful feedback may lead to a warning.
- Persistent negativity or trolling will result in a temporary mute or ban, depending on the severity.
