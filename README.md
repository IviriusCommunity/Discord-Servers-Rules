# Ivirius Community Discord Server Extended Rules

## 1. Follow Discord’s Terms of Service

All members of this server must comply with [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). These rules exist to ensure a safe, fair, and enjoyable experience for everyone.

### Illegal Activities

- Any activity that violates local, national, or international laws is strictly prohibited.
- Examples include (but are not limited to): hacking, sharing pirated software/media, engaging in fraudulent behavior, posting or requesting NSFW content, doxxing, promoting or glorifying crime, and distributing illegal substances.

> [!NOTE]
> This also applies to the **promotion or glorification** of illegal practices, even if expressed as a “joke” or “opinion.”
>
> * **Piracy:** Romanticizing piracy as “liberating people from the world of proprietary software” or encouraging others to pirate games, movies, or software is **not tolerated**.
> * **FOSS Ideology:** We respect Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as a valid development model, but using it as a justification for promoting **software cracking, license evasion, or redistribution of proprietary content without permission** is forbidden.
> * **Meme Defense:** Claiming illegal activity is “just a meme” or “for educational purposes” does not excuse the rule violation.

### Age Requirements

- Discord requires all users to be at least **13 years old** (or older, depending on your country’s regulations).
- Anyone found violating this rule will be **permanently banned with no appeal** and reported directly to Discord Trust & Safety.

> [!NOTE]
> If we have **reasonable suspicion** that you do not meet the minimum age requirement to use Discord, staff may take precautionary action.
>
> * This can include temporarily restricting access, requesting clarification, or issuing a ban if the situation is clear.
> * Attempts to **evade detection** (e.g., lying about age, using a fake birthdate, or creating multiple accounts) will result in a permanent ban.
> * These measures exist to **protect both the community and younger users**, in line with Discord’s own safety policies.

### Harmful Content

- Do not share malicious links, harmful software, or anything intended to damage others’ devices or accounts.
- This includes phishing attempts, scams, malware, Trojans, IP grabbers, viruses, or any suspicious “free Nitro”, online casino, or investment schemes.

### Account Integrity

- Using multiple accounts (alts) to **evade bans, manipulate polls, inflate numbers, or impersonate others** is strictly prohibited.
- Alts are permitted only for:

  - Trusted community members with prior staff approval.
  - Server admins and Ivirius Team members for **testing or emergency purposes**.

- Sharing or selling your Discord account is against both Discord’s ToS and this server’s rules. Offenders will be **banned without warning**.

### Exploits

- Abusing features like `@everyone` / `@here`, mass mentions, or using webhooks to bypass permissions is forbidden.
- Exploiting bugs, loopholes, or vulnerabilities (whether in Discord, server bots such as **Zippy**, or third-party integrations) for personal gain or disruption is not allowed.
- If you discover an exploit, **report it immediately** to Discord or server staff instead of taking advantage of it.

### Consequences

Any violation of Discord’s Terms of Service will result in an **instant ban** from the server, with reports sent to Discord Trust & Safety if necessary.  
Final discretion on rule enforcement lies with the server staff.

## 2. Be Respectful

Respect is the foundation of any good community. Treat everyone with kindness and dignity, even if you disagree with their opinions or beliefs.

### No Harassment or Bullying

- Personal attacks, insults, threats, or any form of harassment are strictly prohibited.
- This includes **DM spamming, stalking, dogpiling, or targeting someone repeatedly** across channels.

### No Hate Speech or Discrimination

- Content or behavior that targets individuals or groups based on **race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, preferences, or other personal attributes** will not be tolerated.
- This includes slurs, offensive jokes at someone’s expense, or subtle discrimination (“dogwhistles”).

> [!NOTE]
> There is a clear line between **targeted discrimination** and **misrepresenting someone’s statements as offensive**. Pretending to be offended or twisting another member’s words in order to make it look like they are violating the rules is considered **intentional misconduct**.
>
> - Innocuous comments or personal preferences are **not automatically discriminatory**. Do not escalate or fabricate violations based on assumptions about someone’s intent.
> - Repeatedly accusing others of discrimination without cause, or attempting to manipulate staff decisions by exaggerating minor remarks, will be treated as harassment and may result in warnings or bans.
> - This rule exists to maintain a **fair and rational community** where members can participate without fear of being unfairly targeted.

### Maintain a Positive Tone

- Disagreements are fine, but keep discussions **civil and constructive**.
- Avoid escalating arguments into toxic or hostile exchanges.
- Example:

  - You may state your favorite operating system or Windows mod.
  - You may not start arguments claiming your opinion is the *only correct one* or belittling others for their choices.

### No Public Shaming

- If someone breaks a rule, **ping an active staff member** instead of calling them out publicly.
- Public shaming often creates drama and makes situations worse.

### Respect Staff and Their Decisions

- Moderators, admins, and Ivirius Team members work hard to keep the server running smoothly.
- Follow their instructions, and respect their final authority in disputes.

### No Ragebaiting

* Do not post messages, images, or content **intended to provoke, annoy, or anger others**.
* This includes trolling, intentionally inflammatory statements, or posting controversial topics with the goal of starting arguments.
* Staff will evaluate whether content is genuinely provocative; repeated attempts to stir drama may result in warnings, mutes, or bans.
* Remember: expressing opinions respectfully is fine, but **deliberately provoking others is not tolerated**.

> [!NOTE]
> Ragebaiting differs from legitimate debate or discussion. Sharing strong opinions or unpopular viewpoints is allowed **if presented respectfully**, but doing so purely to elicit reactions will be considered a rule violation.
>
> * A **well-structured opinion** is supported with reasoning, evidence, or clear explanations and is open to discussion or counterpoints.
> * A **wild claim** is an unsubstantiated statement, extreme exaggeration, or shocking assertion made primarily to provoke outrage or gain attention, rather than to foster meaningful discussion.

### Consequences

- **Minor offenses** may result in a warning.
- **Repeated or severe violations** (e.g., hate speech, bullying, harassment) may result in temporary or permanent bans, at staff discretion.

## 3. No Spamming

Spamming disrupts conversations, clutters channels, and annoys other members. Keep the chat clean and organized by avoiding excessive or irrelevant content.

### No Repetitive Messages

- Avoid sending the same message, emoji, or link multiple times in a short period.
- Repeating the same message or reaction will be considered spam.

### No Flooding Channels

- Do not send large volumes of messages in quick succession, especially when they are irrelevant to the topic or channel.
- This includes excessive use of role mentions or pings.

### No Automated Accounts

- Using bots, scripts, or macros to flood channels or perform actions repeatedly is strictly prohibited.
- This includes automated messages, fake giveaways, or disruptive bot activity.
- Any account found to be automated will be **banned and reported to Discord immediately**.

### No Unsolicited Links or Advertisements

- Do not post links to external websites, content, or promotions unless it’s relevant to the channel, explicitly allowed, or part of the conversation.
- Unsolicited advertisements, even in DMs, are not allowed.

### Consequences

- Spamming will result in a **warning**, followed by a **mute** or **temporary ban** if the behavior continues.

## 4. Keep it Friendly and SFW (Safe for Work)

This is a space for everyone, so we aim to keep the content appropriate for all ages and backgrounds. Avoid sharing any material that is explicit, offensive, or inappropriate for a general audience.

### No NSFW Content

- Explicit, graphic, or adult content (including images, videos, and text) is strictly prohibited.
- This includes anything sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate for public spaces.

### Keep Language PG

- Avoid using excessive profanity or offensive language in both text and voice channels.
- While casual language is allowed in general chat channels, remember to respect others and maintain a friendly environment.
- Some words are filtered for a reason; evading the Automod filter will result in sanctions.

### Respect the Community's Comfort Zones

- Understand that not everyone is comfortable with certain topics.
- Always consider the comfort of others before sharing sensitive or potentially triggering content.

### No Glorifying Harmful Content

- Glorifying harmful behavior, such as self-harm, substance abuse, or violence, is strictly forbidden.
- Venting is not allowed in this server to protect both you and other members. This topic can expose sensitive details about you that should be kept private. Venting in DMs without permission is also prohibited.
- If you or someone else needs help, reach out to a trusted friend, therapist, or appropriate support channels outside the server.

### Sensitive Topics

- You are not allowed to bring up sensitive topics such as real-world politics, drama, or bad behaviors.
- If you need to discuss a serious issue that requires talking about a sensitive topic, please do so **privately with an admin or in a controlled thread** in the #general channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider it a joke or not, the word "acrylic" falls into this category. This rule is not just about preserving the server’s unique charm - it’s also a **test of respect for community boundaries**.
>
> - Members who deliberately break rules, even minor or “fun” ones, demonstrate a pattern of behavior that is likely to extend to other, more serious rules.
> - Following these rules shows that you **value the safety, comfort, and cohesion of the community**, not just your personal preferences.
> - If you break one rule on purpose *just because you don’t like it*, it signals to staff that you may ignore other rules in the future, increasing the likelihood of temporary or permanent action.
>
> For the full context and reasoning, see [here](https://ivirius.com/docs/).

### Consequences

- Posting NSFW or harmful content will result in an **instant ban**.

## 5. Use Channels Appropriately

Each channel is designed for a specific type of content. Posting in the correct channel helps keep the server organized and makes it easier for everyone to find relevant information.

### Stay On-Topic

- Each channel has a defined focus. Always post content that aligns with the purpose of the channel.
- Use general discussion channels for casual topics or conversations unrelated to a channel’s primary purpose.
- Avoid posting personal chats or unrelated content in project or specialized channels.

### Community Projects Channels

- Share your own projects or work in the #general channel **only once**.
- To get a dedicated project channel, contact a member of the Ivirius team.
- Each project channel may have additional posting guidelines - make sure to follow them.
- Project channel owners have full authority over their channels.
- Keep project discussions focused; avoid spamming unrelated content.

### Ivirius Community Projects Channels

- For projects created by @ivirius.software or related to Ivirius Community, use the designated `Projects` category.
- These channels are strictly for official or team-related projects.

### No Cross-Posting Between Channels

- Do not copy and paste the same message into multiple channels; cross-posting can clutter the server and disrupt discussion.
- If you need feedback in multiple areas, summarize the content and direct users to the appropriate channel.
- Forwarding messages is allowed for casual conversation but abusing this will be considered spam.

### Respect Channel-Specific Rules

- Some channels have additional posting rules (e.g., image/file size limits, formatting for project posts).
- Always check pinned messages and channel descriptions to ensure you follow these guidelines.

### Consequences

- Posting in the wrong channel will result in a reminder to move your message.
- Repeated off-topic posts or disruptive behavior in project channels may result in a warning or temporary mute.

## 6. No Unhinged Behavior

We encourage a fun, lively community, but unhinged or erratic behavior can disrupt the experience for others. Keep things balanced, respectful, and avoid actions that make others uncomfortable or create chaos.

### No Outbursts or Aggression

- Avoid sudden outbursts, aggressive behavior, or extreme reactions that disrupt conversations or create an uncomfortable atmosphere.

### Keep it Calm and Civil

- Maintain control over your actions and reactions. Passionate discussions are allowed, but extreme behavior (e.g., yelling, rage quitting) is not acceptable.

### No Over-the-Top Drama

- Drama or exaggerated behavior for attention is discouraged. The goal is to keep the server fun and engaging without unnecessary disruptions.
- Disapproving of someone being a member without proof that they broke a rule is strictly prohibited.
- You may not ask server admins or Ivirius team members to assign you roles.

### No Senseless Arguments

- Engaging in arguments solely to provoke others is not tolerated.
- If a discussion becomes unproductive, move on.

### Maintain Emotional Control

- If you feel frustrated or upset, take a break. It’s okay to step away rather than react impulsively.
- This server is not intended to be a teenage hub or personal emotional support group. Keep personal life details private.

### Consequences

- Unhinged behavior will result in a warning, followed by a mute or temporary ban if it continues.
- Severe or repeated outbursts may lead to a permanent ban.

## 7. Private Testers and Confidentiality

* The private testing channel is reserved for verified testers who have agreed to follow strict confidentiality guidelines. As a tester, you are trusted with pre-release content and are expected to handle it responsibly.

### Verification Process

* To become a tester, you must go through a verification process. Simply asking to join does not guarantee access.
* The verification ensures that testers understand the responsibilities involved and are trustworthy.

### Confidentiality is Crucial

* Anything shared in the private testing channel is confidential. Do not share, leak, or discuss any testing content outside of the designated channels.
* Leaking information about unannounced features, bugs, or updates will result in immediate removal from the testing program and possible server bans.

### Respect for Non-Disclosure

* Do not post or share screenshots, videos, or any other content related to the software you’re testing unless given explicit permission.
* Avoid discussing the test in public channels or with anyone who is not part of the private testing group.

### No Spoilers

* Avoid giving spoilers or hints about upcoming features, releases, or updates unless explicitly allowed.
* This includes hinting at or teasing new features that could spoil the experience for others.

### Feedback and Reporting

* Testers are expected to provide constructive feedback and report bugs or issues in a timely manner.
* Use the designated feedback channels and follow any guidelines for submitting reports.

### Country Restrictions

* If you live in the following countries: `Russia, China`, you are not allowed to become a tester.
* This rule ensures copies of our apps are not distributed in blacklisted regions.
* Do not argue that this decision is discriminatory or racist. The blacklist exists for your safety and to comply with the laws of these countries.

### Consequences

* Violating confidentiality, leaking information, or failing to follow the rules will result in removal from the testing group and potential server ban.
* Severe breaches of trust may lead to permanent removal from the community.

## 8. No Wild Claims

Making unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims can mislead others and disrupt the community. Stick to facts and avoid making statements that are misleading, false, or overly subjective without evidence.

### No False or Misleading Statements

- Avoid making claims that are not backed by evidence, such as calling a program "malware" without proof or spreading misinformation.
- Statements like “Rebound 11 is malware” or “one software is better than another” are not allowed.
- You are allowed to show your support for a project as long as you do not actively compare it to another project in a disparaging way.

### Avoid Unsubstantiated Comparisons

- Everyone has different preferences, so try not to elevate one product while putting down another unfairly.
- Do not trash talk a project to support another.

### No Extremist Opinions on Platforms

- Claims like "everyone should use \[Operating System/Device]" or similar statements that try to push a singular viewpoint on others are discouraged.
- People should be free to choose what works best for them without being pressured or shamed for their preferences.

### Encourage Civil Discussion

- If you want to discuss your preferences or opinions about software or operating systems, keep it respectful and allow room for differing opinions.
- Debate ideas constructively rather than making absolute claims.

### Differentiating Opinions vs. Wild Claims

- A **well-structured opinion** is backed by reasoning, evidence, or experience and presented respectfully. Example: “I prefer OS X for its development tools, but Windows works better for gaming.”
- A **wild claim** is an exaggerated, unsubstantiated, or provocative statement intended to shock, mislead, or provoke reactions. Example: “Anyone who uses Windows is a failure” or “Linux users are all hackers.”
- Sharing opinions is encouraged, but attempting to create drama, outrage, or spread misinformation will be treated as a violation.

### Consequences

- Repeated wild claims will result in a warning.
- Continued violations will lead to a temporary mute or ban, depending on the severity of the claims.

## 9. Provide Constructive Feedback

Constructive feedback helps improve the community and projects. If you have suggestions or criticisms, make sure they are thoughtful, respectful, and helpful.

### Be Specific and Clear

- When providing feedback, be specific about what you like or dislike. Instead of saying “This doesn’t work,” try saying, “The feature crashes when I click this button.”
- Offering clear examples or detailed explanations helps others understand your point of view.

### Focus on Improvement

- The goal of feedback is to improve, not to complain. Frame your criticism in a way that encourages growth, such as, “It would be better if this feature had X because Y,” rather than just pointing out flaws.

### Be Respectful

- Feedback should be given respectfully. Avoid using offensive language or attacking others.
- Remember, everyone is working hard to make things better, and a positive approach will yield better results.

### Stay Open to Responses

- Understand that not all feedback will lead to immediate changes. Developers and staff may need time to consider suggestions or explain why certain decisions were made.
- Keep an open mind and engage in productive dialogue.

### Provide Solutions When Possible

- If you notice a problem, try suggesting a possible solution or improvement. Offering ideas on how to fix an issue makes your feedback more actionable and helpful.

### Consequences

- Repeatedly giving unhelpful or disrespectful feedback may lead to a warning.
- Persistent negativity or trolling will result in a temporary mute or ban, depending on the severity.
